==============================
Changes from 1.1:
==============================

* Fixed an issue where the installer would crash on pre-AVX CPUs.

==============================
Changes from 1.0:
==============================

* Steam compatibility.
  * Lots of internal updates.
  * Removed memory fragmentation workaround as the Steam version now has its own.
  * Steam Play (Linux) support.
* Some new translation fixes.
* Includes new prompt explaining the delusion trigger controls.
  * Because Z and C are certainly not the most obvious choice.
* Fixed patch installer not working on certain Windows installations lacking multimedia components.
* Fixed game engine bug involving My Documents paths containing special characters on OneDrive. 
  * We haven't checked if the Steam version still has this issue, but both STEINS;GATE 0 and the Japanese version of CHAOS;CHILD did.
* Worked around game engine bug where, when pausing right before a voiced line, line would fail to play and game would crash on the next voiced line.
* Fixed the goddamn title music.
  * In 1.0, our HQ audio option had a bug preventing the title screen BGM from playing if the intro video isn't skipped. Sorry about that.
* Installer now ships as a ZIP archive instead of a self-extracting executable.
